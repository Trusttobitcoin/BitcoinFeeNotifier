# BitcoinFeeNotifier
BitcoinFeeNotifier is a VB.NET script designed to display the current Bitcoin transaction fee in the system tray, updating every 5 seconds. The script fetches this data from the Mempool Space API and is intended to run unobtrusively in the system tray, providing real-time updates with minimal user interaction.
